# Sign Language Translation using Computer Vision

### Our project uses the following technologies and flow:
1. Tkinter based GUI application interface
2. Video streaming using users camera
3. Video processing using OpenCV
4. Detection of sign language in the stream using TensorFlow Object Detection API
5. Processing of the detected sign language using bespoke TensorFlow Keras Sequential Model
6. Displaying detected sign language translation in the form of text and speech to the user(s)

#### Collabarators
